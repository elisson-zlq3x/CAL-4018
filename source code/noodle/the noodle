\ CAL interprets a pair of double-quotes
\   (in the source code that defines a string)
\   as one double-quote (in the defined string).
\ When parsing command lines in the Windows NT shell scripting language:
\  * One or more consecutive unquoted white-space characters
\    are treated as a single token delimiter.
\  * Treats single-quotes as ordinary characters.
\  * Does not eat double quotes.
\  * If an even number of double-quotes have been handled,
\    treats white space normally.
\  * If an odd number of double-quotes have been handled,
\    treats white space as ordinary characters.
\ The preceding test verifies that CAL has the same behavior.
