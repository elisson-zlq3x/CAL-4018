\ The further left the byte, the less significant the byte is.
\ But within a byte, the further left the bit,
\ the more significant the bit is.

\ The low number is treated as unsigned.
\ The low number ranges from 0 through biggest number - smallest number,
\ not from smallest number through biggest number.

\ a premix can store a mixio as a bigint, measured in trifles.
\ In other words, it is an implied ratio of the bigint / (43,200*43,200).
A premix is a bigint.

\ A binary logarithm represents log base 2 of a value.
\ A binary logarithm is similar to a float,
\ but the mantissa is used differently.
\ Both have some bits and a mantissa.
\
\ A float's mantissa is not logarithmic,
\ but a float's bits are logarithmic.
\ A float with positive bits is evaluated
\ by left shifting its mantissa by the bits.
\ A float with negative bits is evaluated
\ by right shifting its mantissa by the negative of the bits.
\
\ In a binary logarithm,
\ both the bits and the mantissa are logarithmic.
\
\ A binary logarithm is similar to a mixed:
\ The bits are the whole number (which can be negative, zero, or positive).
\ The mantissa is the fractional part (which can be zero or positive).
\ The bits are added to the mantissa to get the full value of the binary logarithm.
\
\ To find the antilog of a binary logarithm,
\ de-sign both the bits and the mantissa,
\ raise 2 to the power of the mantissa,
\ left shift the result by the bits,
\ and if the original logarithm was negative, invert the result.
\
A binary logarithm has some bits and a mantissa.

\ In this library,
\ a mantissa represents a ratio, with an implied denominator of 2^61.
\ Properties of the mantissa of a float during intermediate calculations:
\   Bit #64 (the sign bit) is 0.
\   Bit #63 (the 2^62 place) may be 0 or 1.
\ Properties of the mantissa of a float when normalized as a float:
\   Bit #64 is the sign bit.  It may be 0 or 1:
\     0 means the float is zero or positive.
\     1 means the float is zero or negative.
\   Bit #63 (the 2^62 place) is 0.
\   Either the mantissa is 0, or bit #62 (the 2^61 place) is 1.
\
\ The mantissa of a binary logarithm is never negative.
\ It represents a fractional logarithmic value in base 2.
