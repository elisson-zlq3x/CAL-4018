A byte array has
  A string, and
  A bedrock count.
  \ The bedrock count is the number of contiguous bytes,
  \ starting with the first byte of the string,
  \ that have been determined to have valid values.
  \ It is possible for bytes after the bedrock count
  \ to have valid values, but it is also possible for
  \ some or all such bytes to be 0 because their
  \ correct values have not been determined yet.

To clear a one-indexed position in a flag array:
  Convert the one-indexed position to a zero-indexed position.
  Divide the zero-indexed position by 8 giving a quotient and a remainder.
  Put the quotient in another zero-indexed position.
  Convert the other zero-indexed position to another one-indexed position.
  Get a byte from the flag array's byte array at the other one-indexed position.
  Put 2 in a number.
  Raise the number to the remainder.
  Put the number in another byte.
  Invert the other byte.
  Bitwise and the byte with the other byte.
  Set the byte in the flag array's byte array at the other one-indexed position.
  Put the flag array's bedrock count in a count.
  Add 1 to the count.
  If the one-indexed position is the count,
    Put the count in the flag array's bedrock count.

To convert a one-indexed position to a zero-indexed position:
  Put the one-indexed position in the zero-indexed position.
  Subtract 1 from the zero-indexed position.

To convert a zero-indexed position to a one-indexed position:
  Put the zero-indexed position in the one-indexed position.
  Add 1 to the one-indexed position.

To decide if a one-indexed position is clear in a flag array:

To decide if a one-indexed position is set in a flag array:
  Convert the one-indexed position to a zero-indexed position.
  Divide the zero-indexed position by 8 giving a quotient and a remainder.
  Put the quotient in another zero-indexed position.
  Convert the other zero-indexed position to another one-indexed position.
  Get a byte from the flag array's byte array at the other one-indexed position.
  Put 2 in a number.
  Raise the number to the remainder.
  If the number is bitwise included in the byte,
    Say yes.
  Say no.

A flag array has
  A byte array, and
  A bedrock count.
  \ The bedrock count is the number of contiguous bits,
  \ starting with the first bit of the flag array,
  \ that have been determined to have valid values.
  \ It is possible for bits after the bedrock count
  \ to have valid values, but it is also possible for
  \ some or all such bits to be 0 because their
  \ correct values have not been determined yet.

To get a byte from a byte array at a one-indexed position:
  Get the byte from the byte array's string at the one-indexed position.

To grow a byte array through a count:
  If the byte array's capacity is at least the count, exit.
  Privatize the count.
  Subtract the byte array's capacity from the count.
  Fill a string with the null byte given the count.
  Append the string to the byte array's string.

To grow a flag array through a count:
  If the flag array's capacity is at least the count, exit.

  \ there are 8 bits in a byte.
  Round the count up to the nearest multiple of 8.
  Divide the count by 8.
  Grow the flag array's byte array through the count.

A one-indexed position is a number.

To put a byte array's capacity into a count:
  Put the byte array's string's length into the count.

To put a flag array's capacity into a count:
  Put the flag array's byte array's capacity into the count.

To set a byte in a byte array at a one-indexed position:

  Put the string's first into a byte pointer.
  Convert the one-indexed position to a zero-indexed position.
  Add the zero-indexed position to the byte pointer.
  Put the byte in the byte pointer's target.

    Put the capacity in the count.
